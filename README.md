# sssa_deformability

This folder contain the dataset acquired during the experiment described in:

A. Mazzeo, M. Uliano, P. Mucci, M. Penzotti, L. Angelini, F. Cini, L. Craighero, M. Controzzi, 2023, "Human manipulation strategy when changing object deformability and task properties".

Each csv file has 12 columns (one per experimental condition) and 20 row (title of the condition, subjects 1-19).

In this folder:
* _A_reaching_time.csv_ contains the mean reaching time of each subject in each condition;
* _B_transport_time.csv_ contains the mean transport time of each subject in each condition;
* _C_insertion_time.csv_ contains the mean insertion time of each subject in each condition;
* _D_GPCP_distance.csv_ contains the mean grasping point (GP) -control point (CP) distance of each subject in each condition;
* _E_number_of_regrasps.csv_ contains the median number of re-grasps adopted by  each subject in each condition;
* _F_reachvel_reaching_time.csv_ contains the mean reaching time of each subject in each condition computed from the reaching velocity profile;
* _G_reachvel_accel_time_perc.csv_ contains the mean acceleration time rate (%) of the reaching movement of each subject in each condition;
* _H_reachvel_decel_time_perc.csv_ contains the mean deceleration time rate (%) of the reaching movement of each subject in each condition;
* _I_reachvel_peak_velocity.csv_ contains the mean peak velocity of the reaching movement of each subject in each condition.
